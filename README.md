### 🔍 Project Overview
Crimes against women remain a **serious social challenge** in India.  
This project analyzes **two decades (2001–2022)** of women-related crime data and builds an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to uncover hidden insights.  

📌 Project Objectives:  
- 📊 **Understand Long-Term Trends** → How crime rates against women have changed from 2001 to 2022.  
- 🗂 **Categorical Analysis** → Deep dive into categories like *Rape, Dowry Deaths, Domestic Violence, Kidnapping, Trafficking* and their contribution to total crimes.  
- 🗺 **Geographical Focus** → Identify which states/regions report the highest number of cases, and spot regional crime patterns.  
- ⏳ **Temporal Trends** → Explore crime growth year-by-year and detect sudden spikes.  
- 🔮 **Future Forecasting** → Use historical patterns to project future risks if preventive measures are not taken.  
- 🧾 **Data Storytelling** → Present insights in a way that can help policymakers, NGOs, and researchers understand the ground reality.
